## About this Repository
This repository is a fork of the `online-cv` Jekyll theme, originally created by [sharu725](https://github.com/sharu725). It's customized to present my professional profile and is updated regularly with my latest professional achievements.

A special thanks to `sharu725` for developing such a versatile and easy-to-use Jekyll theme!
